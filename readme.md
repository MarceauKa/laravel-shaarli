# Laravel Shaarli

It's a **free and open source platform** to host by yourself. **Shaarli** allows you to **save your web links** 
(websites, youtube videos, ...), to **share your stories** and **manage your web accounts**. 

All of your content can be **private or public** and can be browsed by **tags** or **all-in-one search**.

It's ready to use for **production**. **Laravel Shaarli** is inspired by [Shaarli](https://github.com/shaarli/Shaarli) 
but built with [Laravel](https://github.com/laravel/laravel) and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/).

### Additional configuration

Laravel Shaarli is built with [Laravel 6](https://laravel.com/docs/6.x/installation). There's many ways to configuration database, session, mail and queue:
- Database can use MySQL (default), SQLite or Postgre SQL (see [database configuration](https://laravel.com/docs/6.x/database))
- Session can use file (default), cookie, database or redis (see [session configuration](https://laravel.com/docs/6.x/session))
- Mail can use sendmail (default), smtp, mailgun, postmark or amazon ses (see [mail configuration](https://laravel.com/docs/6.x/mail#driver-prerequisites))
- Queue (optional) can use sync (default), redis, database, beanstalkd, amazon sqs (see [queue configuration](https://laravel.com/docs/6.x/queues))   

## Archiving

Each link you share can be archived the way you want:

- [youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/) when available on your system, will be used to download media
from youtube, soundcloud, vimeo and [few more sites](http://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/supportedsites.html).

- [Puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer) will be used by default to save the webpage as a PDF.

You can adjust archiving configuration and test it in the settings section.

## Contribute

### Features and bugs

All contributions are welcome! Please use the `dev` branch for your pull requests.  
If you make changes to JS, don't compile assets in production, I'll manually compile them when merging for security reasons.

### Translation

Shaarli is actually available in **English**, **French** and **German**. Feel free to make a pull request to add or update a localization. 
You can see laravel base localizations [on this repo](https://github.com/caouecs/Laravel-lang).

### Your Shaarli

You host your own Shaarli public instance and you want to share it with other Shaarliers? 
You can make a pull request to add it to our public listing located at [shaarlies.md](https://github.com/MarceauKa/laravel-shaarli/blob/dev/shaarlies.md). 

## Security

If you find any **security issues**, please send me an email (can be found in composer.json).

### Global privacy

If you don't want your content being publicy accessible, you can update this preference once application is installed from settings section.

### 2-FA

You're able to active 2-FA (2 factors authentication). By default 2-FA is disabled but you can update it from your app settings. 
Code length and code expiration are also configurable. **Test if you application can send emails before enabling this feature**.

### Auth monitoring

Shaarli logs all successful and failed auths with their associated devices.

### Chests encryption

Since `1.2.9`, all chests data are encrypted in your database using AES-256-CBC and your app key.

### Multi-users

Others users can be admin or non-admin. Admin users are like the main user and have an access to the entire content. 
Non-admin users can't access the settings section and can only see their own private content.

## Update

Update the application by running or use the `php artisan shaarli:update`.

```bash
php artisan down
git reset --hard
git pull origin master
composer install --no-dev -o
php artisan migrate --force -n
php artisan storage:link
